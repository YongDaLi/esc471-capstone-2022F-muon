Given the data acquired from the three oscilloscope channels, corresponding to the three scintillators (2 up, 1 down), count the number of up and down events. 

An up event is a muon decay event whose daughter electron is emitted upwards.
A down event is a muon decay event whose daughter electron is emitted downwards.
